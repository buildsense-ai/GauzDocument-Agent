# Cursor Rules for GauzDocument-Agent Project

## Environment Setup
- Always use the `gauz-agent-py312` conda environment for this project
- Python version: 3.12.11 (Required for camel-ai compatibility)
- Environment path: `/Users/zhuhanyuan/anaconda3/envs/gauz-agent-py312`

## Terminal Commands
When running terminal commands in this project:
1. Ensure the conda environment `gauz-agent-py312` is activated
2. If not activated, run: `conda activate gauz-agent-py312`
3. All Python commands should use the environment's Python interpreter

## Code Execution Rules
- Use Python 3.12.11 from the gauz-agent-py312 environment
- Install packages using: `pip install <package>` (within the activated environment)
- For conda packages use: `conda install -n gauz-agent-py312 <package>`

## Important Version Notes
- Python 3.12.x is REQUIRED (not 3.13) due to camel-ai dependency limitations
- All dependencies in requirements.txt are verified for Python 3.12 compatibility

## Project Structure
This is a Python-based AI agent system with the following key components:
- `src/` - Main source code directory
- `frontend/` - Web interface
- `Paper2Poster/` - PDF processing dependencies
- `tasks/` - Generated task files

## Development Workflow
1. Always activate conda environment first
2. Run tests before making changes
3. Use the provided test script: `python 快速修复导入问题测试.py`
4. Follow the渐进式重构执行计划.md for refactoring guidelines

## Dependencies Management
- Use `requirements.txt` for Python packages
- Keep environment isolated from base conda environment
- Document new dependencies as they are added
